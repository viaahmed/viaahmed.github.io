## Welcome to My site (Its under setup)

ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
I am Ahmed Muddasir.
This is my personal site. I use it to host any files I want to share with the world. 

## What do I do?
I use markdown, a text formatting language ðŸ˜‰. It uses syntax to format text. The available syntax are illustrated below:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

This site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I have selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/viaahmed/viaahmed.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
